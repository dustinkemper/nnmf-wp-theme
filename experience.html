          <p>Cook’s Valley Campground is a site unlike any other you’ve likely experienced.  It is a rare gem; a breathtaking locale that amazingly juxtaposes a feeling of remoteness with surprisingly easy accessibility. Adjacent to US Highway 101 on the border of Humboldt &amp; Mendocino county in Northern California, this location is nestled along the Eel River in the towering Redwood forest (we call it the “Infinite Redwood Curtain”).</p>

          <p>Home to numerous successful events, Cook’s Valley Campground  offers a unique and safe festival experience for both newcomers and well-seasoned campers alike. Cook’s Valley features deep swimming holes along the Eel River, expansive and landscaped grassy areas for lounging, and the largest Redwood grove in the valley is used for camping.</p>

      <p>Northern Nights Music Festival is a 3-day celebration of music, art, food and culture.  The event takes place at Cook’s Valley Campground on July 19th – July 21st 2013 on a location that has hosted highly acclaimed music festivals for more than 20 years.</p>

      <p>Our mission:  To produce an annual event based on a strong understanding &amp; passionate support system of emerging underground music industries – featuring sought out producers &amp; DJs, both regionally and from around the globe.  All this takes place surrounded by California’s Redwood Forest sanctuary, a setting of unparalleled beauty that enchants the senses of each attendee and highlights the rich festival history of the region.</p>

      <p>Our collective hope: creating a premiere destination festival along the Eel River that encourages attendees to embrace a truly Californian experience.  Lighting, sound, and stage production for multiple stages are provided by SF Bay Area’s finest production teams in collaboration with renowned Humboldt County promoters and producers. Accompanying world class music acts are a collection of local and global craft vendors, food &amp; beverage purveyors, and yoga yard built to host teachers from around the US.</p>

      <p><i>Paying it forward:</i>  In alignment with the tradition of previous festivals, a portion of the proceeds from ticket and beverage sales are donated to the Mendocino and Humboldt school districts, non-profits, and environmental groups.</p>
