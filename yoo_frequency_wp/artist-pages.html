    <p>"Come with us on a trip through your inner dimensions…."</p>
    <p>Growing like wildfire under the canopy of live electonica and world roots music comes a masterful merge of modern technology, live instrumentation and seductive performance, built of brass bands and glitch, string quartets and dubstep: the musical Oakland based trio Beats Antique. Since the group’s inception from the eclectic underground of San Francisco’s performance art scene, Beats Antique has been notorious for making it nearly impossible to sit still. They meld their mediums as attentively as they fuse the cultures that inspire their sound. All self produced and composed, the trio creates a unique collage: an animalistic, raw musical event that blurs the lines between the provocative, the spiritual, and the artistic, while still maintaining an allegiance to the muses of class and beauty. This Electronic/World fusion dance trio brings you their new album and multi-media touring show “A Thousand Faces”, a journey beyond the sonic realm that’s part odyssey, part genre-warping rock opera. </p>

    <p>Just outside the jazz mecca of Kansas City springs liberal oasis Lawrence, Kansas— separated only by the waves of wheat from the epicenter of the electronic music revolution in Colorado. From Lawrence, it would logically follow that an act could rise to prominence fueled by the swing of Basie, the birth of Charlie Parker’s bebop, and the wild frontier of electronica. Born in funk and bred in the digital age, live electronic duo The Floozies have burst onto the scene at a time when the industry needed them the most. Brothers Matt and Mark Hill share the stage just as easily as they share a musical brain. Without a setlist, and without a word between them, Matt’s guitar is in lockstep with the thud of Mark’s kick. Endless looping and production builds the raw scenery upon which palm muted chugs, searing solos, and wobbling bass paint their dazzling array of colors. These two are bringing their fresh approach to electronic music and live performance to venues and festivals all over the country. The duo's combination of cutting edge electronic production and party rocking funk energizes crowds and turns venues into epic dance parties.

    <p>With a robust early following and organic online buzz, Giraffage offers a fresh, sample-rich sound of dreamy pop beats, sensual synths and lush experimental electronica. The creation of 23 year-old Charlie Yin of San Francisco, Giraffage is an exciting new producer with an intuitive grasp of modern music manipulation, delivering beats that are dripping with vibes and accessible to all.</p>
    <p>Starting his musical journey in high school as a drummer for an eclectic array of bands from metal to indie rock, Yin turned to guitar and then soon moved to electronic music production on illegally downloaded software. Inspired by such pioneers as Daft Punk and Boards of Canada, Giraffage is a true bedroom producer that started playing out only after gaining solid traction for his music online. Sending out his first album for free to various music blogs and online publications, Giraffage quickly found an ardent fan following for his hazy and seductive style.</p>

    <p>EPROM is one of the vibrant West-Coast scene’s most colourful characters and an important cog in the international Rwina machine. He’s a consummate post-millennial producer, and his sound varies from toxic hip-hop to searing garage mutations to bizarre concoctions somewhere in between. His beats jiggle and drip and contort wildly, always in some perpetual state of melting, churning, and mutation. </p>
    <p>He’s had releases on Warp, Surefire, and Bristol-based Bad Acid, but it’s his Rwina releases that have been the most visible and enduring, whether it’s the timestretch torture and fierce melodic geysers of “Humanoid” or deconstructionist mayhem of his “Pipe Dream” EP, where dubstep and grime collide for a staggering beast that shakes off heavy blotches of radioactive fluorescent sludge with every beat that lands. His live sets are something to behold as well, emphasizing the hip-hop roots that lurk underneath his sewer beats, and an hour of EPROM is bound to turn your brain into to the same sort of goo that gums the gears of his distinctive beats.</p>

    <p>The Fort Knox Five have the Midas touch for producing heavy hitting records. Since 2003, they have released an arsenal of floor rocking singles and remixes from their Washington DC based label: Fort Knox Recordings.</p>
    <p>Sid Barcelona, Jon Horvath, Rob Myers and Steve Raskin are the masterminds behind the Fort Knox Five. Their signature ‘Fort Knox Sound’ seamlessly interweaves live instrumentation with funky electronic breakbeats. In 2006 they released the critically acclaimed ‘The New Gold Standard’ to showcase the groundbreaking sounds from their premier funk and soul label. The Fort Knox Five has coined the term ‘reminted’ to represent their signature remixing style.</p>

    <p>Mention the name Sabo to anyone familiar with the tropical end of electronic music and the response will be unanimous: deep, unquestioning respect, tinged with a healthy measure of awe. For the past 15 years, the globetrotting DJ and producer, now based in Los Angeles after moving from his native New York, has set the benchmark for his peers, thanks to his unmistakable signature style: 'Funky music to make you feel good', as he describes it - an irresistible, resonant, Balearic fusion that draws upon house, tropical bass, Latin, Brazilian, Afrobeat, disco, reggae, Cumbia, Dub, Miami bass, hip hop, funk, soul, and Moombahton. In a glowsticks era when the word 'uplifting' has lost much of its meaning, Sabo's productions, many released via his own Sol*Selectas label, are every bit uplifting as they are finely crafted and timeless.</p>

    <p>A world traveler based in Oakland, Calif., Lafa Taylor is an achieved singer/emcee/producer. His music carries a message of inspiration and activation, while staying gritty, bassy and most importantly danceable. Lafa’s live show is energetic, dynamic and unique. He has a great talent for connecting with his audience and working with the energy of the crowd. His collage of infectiously harmonic, bass heavy, multi tempo music quickly heats up the dance floor. His vocal style ranges from sweet melodic choruses to tongue twisting rhymes. He is also known for his intricate beat boxing, and often incorporates live looping. In the summer of 2003, at age 17, Lafa single handedly produced and released his debut album, “Life Music.” </p>
