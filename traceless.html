    <p>Northern Nights chose Cook’s Valley as its home for its spectacular landscape and environment, that will play host to our 2ND annual festival, on July 18th, 19th, 20th 2014. There is nowhere else on the planet better maintained for mid-summer nights of dancing under the stars, sleeping under the redwoods, and basking in the cool clean waters of the Eel River. We share the same commitment to responsibility of all those before us, to maintain the natural sanctity of this beautiful oasis.  It is ALL of our job to ensure that we respect the land and our surroundings, and take as many measures as we can to protect our weekend home, so that we can preserve its beauty for future generations of visitors and dance lovers to come.</p>

    <p>With this in mind, NNMF is dedicated to SUSTAINABILITY.  From the standpoint of a weekend festival, sustainability relates to the idea of minimizing negative human impact on the venue and its surrounding environment. This means that TOGETHER, we all must take proactive steps to mitigate the waste we create and leave Cook’s Valley, TRACELESS: from the food that we eat, the beverages we drink, the things we smoke, and how we keep ourselves clean. To this end, NNMF will provide the following resources to our guests as mitigative measures to protect our weekend home!</p>

      <h5>Pease check your cars for leaks</h5>
      <p>Keeping the Eel River free of toxins begins with YOU! We will be checking all vehicles upon entry to the venue and no parking will be permitted within 100 ft of the river bar. Please take a quick look under your vehicle before beginning your beautiful drive through the redwoods and if you see a leak, please have it fixed!</p>
      <h5>Bring Earth-Friendly Products</h5>
      <p>Please only bring eco-friendly soaps (e.g. Dr. Bronners) for your showers and washes. Check out this daily-updated list for more recommendations of natural, earth-friendly products we love.</p>
      <h5>Don't urinate in the river</h5>
      <p>You will be punished in the form of having to sit in the silent disco with HARDSTYLE TRANCE on loop. Seriously.</p>
      <h5>Bring wet wipes</h5>
      <p>A Clean Body Makes for a Clean Environment. One of the biggest misconceptions is that damage to the water quality is only from direct deposit into the river – FALSE! Improper wipe-age leads to contaminants in the river, and this is why NNMF is presenting the TRACELESS ASS CAMPAIGN (TAC). Yes, it makes us laugh too. But we think a good laugh makes it memorable, which is all the more important as we are serious about the message. The better you clean yourself, the better it is for the river you swim in, the better it is for the friends you are camping with and most importantly, the cleaner YOU are as human being!  We will provide a limited quantity of wet wipes at the porta-potty locations, but please bring your own as well!</p>

      <h4>The NNMF “TRACELESS” Intiative</h4>
      <p>On top of that rewarding feeling you will get by participating in cleaner party practices, we would like to offer a little extra incentive for those dedicated ecological-over-achievers, for helping us achieve our Greener Festival goals and “TRACELESS” initiatives!</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A free NNMF ticket for recycle crew volunteers <a href="">(Please sign-up here!)</a></li>
        <li>A free bottle of water for every 10 used bottles, cans, or cups returned to the TRACELESS tent</li>
        <li>A free NNMF T-shirt for every 100 cigarette butts returned to the TRACELESS tent (NNMF will provide gloves)</li>
        <li>An on-site TRACELESS info tent will be present where you can learn more about NNMF’s traceless programs.</li>

    <h5>“We have forgotten how to be good guests, how to walk lightly on the earth as it's other creatures do.” – <i>Barbara Ward, Only One Earth (1972)</i></h5>
    <p>As humans, we often separate ourselves from other organisms on Earth. We forget that, like other living things, we play an integral role in our ecosystems.  Ecosystems can be massive (thinking of the solar system) or tiny (microscopic biota in one drop of water).</p>

    <p>The ecosystem occupied by Northern Nights Music Festival is a combination of both the living and non-living elements, from the redwoods to the rocks to endangered salmon and steelhead trout.  Keep an eye to the sky and you may see a bald eagle, great blue heron or osprey. Explore the river and you might encounter a family of river otters or invasive pike minnows.  Needless to say, Northern Nights Music Festival at Cook’s Valley Campground is part of a very sensitive ecosystem.</p>

      <p>Northern Nights Music Festival is fortunate to have found its home on the South Fork Eel River. South Fork is part of the Eel River watershed, the third largest watershed in the California, which dumps into the ocean to the north of NNMF in Humboldt County.  South Fork Eel River is of utmost importance, not just to the wild animal and plant communities in the region, but also to the human communities established within the large watershed.</p>
      <p>South Fork Eel River holds special historical and cultural significance for native Indian groups, and has supported mixed-use human activities for many generations. The myriad uses of South Fork, including recreation, gravel extraction, agriculture and music festivals, is possible only because each stakeholder group closely follow principles of sustainability to ensure the health and cleanliness of the river for everyone else.</p>
      <p>We are honored to have the opportunity to showcase The Arts in such a sacred location on the border of Mendocino and Humboldt counties. Northern Nights is dedicated to the integrity and sustainability of the environment surrounding Cook’s Valley and it is the collective responsibility of event staff and attendees to take proactive steps to mitigate environmental impacts on the Eel River during the festival.</p>

      <p>Northern Nights Music Festival takes place in Mendocino County near the Humboldt County line, and is tucked away in the shadows of a towering redwood forest. You’ll notice that our large event site, the Cook’s Valley Campground, feels dwarfed among these tall Sequoia sempervirens trees, the tallest trees in the world. Sequoia sempervirens, known as the California redwood or coastal redwood, age over 1,000 years old and reach heights upwards of 300 feet!  (Oh, yeah, you know what else lasts that long? PLASTIC.  Bring your own reusable water bottle to NNMF). To see, touch, smell (and maybe taste, if you’re brave!) one of these humongous trees will only add to the unforgettable experience that you will have at Northern Nights Music Festival.</p>
