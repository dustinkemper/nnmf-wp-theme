    <p>We urge all our attendees to be conscious and consider their combined impact when making their travel plans!</p>
    <p>Part of our goal to reduce our overall carbon footprint, starts well before we even arrive at the campsite! Because it is our social and environmental responsibility to take initiative and brainstorm solutions to improving the system of travel and transportation, we have come up with different strategies that with the support of our attendees, together we can accomplish our goal in reducing carbon emissions, traffic congestion, and mechanical pollution on the natural environment</p>

        <h4>Car Pool</h4>
        <p>In order to limit the traffic congestion for the local Humboldt and Mendocino communities and reduce our collective fuel consumption, we urge you to plan ahead and be conscious of your own carbon impact.</p>
        <p>We highly recommend carpooling to Northern Nights Music Festival and feel strongly about using all of the space in your car. We will offer a variety of different transportation options, including a carpool forum to link up with others travelling to Northern Nights and various pick-up spots across the Bay Area and Marin counties for chartered festival buses.</p>
        <p>A tremendous part of the Northern Nights Music Festival experience, is the ride to the party itself! But it just isn’t quite the same when you don’t have a car full of equally awe-inspired smiles to share the experience with. Thus, we urge you to travel responsibly and with one another! Meet new friends and enjoy the incredible sights along Highway 101 together. <i>”Friends don’t let friends ride alone!”</i></p>
        <p>Chartered and Party Buses are allowed and preferred. So go big and round up your whole crew! If you do set up a bus, feel free to reach out to <a href="mailto:info@northernnights.org">info@northernnights.org</a> for assisting with organizing and possible group discounts!</p>
