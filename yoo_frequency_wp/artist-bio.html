        <!-- ADD ARTIST BIO TEXT BELOW -->
        A world traveler based in Oakland, Calif., Lafa Taylor is an achieved singer/emcee/producer. His music carries a message of inspiration and activation, while staying gritty, bassy and most importantly danceable. Lafa’s live show is energetic, dynamic and unique. He has a great talent for connecting with his audience and working with the energy of the crowd. His collage of infectiously harmonic, bass heavy, multi tempo music quickly heats up the dance floor. His vocal style ranges from sweet melodic choruses to tongue twisting rhymes. He is also known for his intricate beat boxing, and often incorporates live looping. In the summer of 2003, at age 17, Lafa single handedly produced and released his debut album, “Life Music.”
