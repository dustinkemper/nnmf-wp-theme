    <p>Cook’s Valley Campground is a site unlike any other you’ve likely experienced.  It is a rare gem; a breathtaking locale that amazingly juxtaposes a feeling of remoteness with surprisingly easy accessibility. Adjacent to US Highway 101 on the border of Humboldt &amp; Mendocino county in Northern California, this location is nestled along the Eel River in the towering Redwood forest (we call it the “Infinite Redwood Curtain”).</p>

    <p>Home to numerous successful events, Cook’s Valley Campground  offers a unique and safe festival experience for both newcomers and well-seasoned campers alike. Cook’s Valley features deep swimming holes along the Eel River, expansive and landscaped grassy areas for lounging, and the largest Redwood grove in the valley is used for camping.</p>
